          <p>I remember my badminton journey started from early summer of 2003 inspired and guided by my very talented 
            childhood friend late Kuldeep Gurung who was also my doubles partner in the later stage whom we unfortunately 
            lost in a bus accident during the NE Zonal championship in Manipur. He introduced me to sir 
            Thendup Tseten Bhutia one of the very passionate and dedicated towards the game, under whose sincere guidance 
            I quickly established as one of the promising player in the state, within a short time I was already in the 
            finals of the state tournaments. But the best came after a couple of years where I was one of the youngest
             men’s State champion and Junior champion in 2006 and 2007. Later I got multiple chances to represent the
              state in nationals and regional tournaments with the support of the BAS.</p>

              <p>
But unfortunately, due to an injury couldn't train or play consistently for a longer time. That’s where I decided pick up 
coaching though it was quite early but my love and interest was really quick and since then there is no looking back. 
After a couple of years of coaching I got selected to pursue the 1year Diploma course in sports coaching from NSNIS 
2014-15. Immediately I got an opportunity work with the Prakash Padukone Sports Management in Bangalore which was of 
great experience. After a few years i moved to Dubai UAE with Prime Star Sports Academy where I am currently working 
as a Head coach of the academy. I am also a BWF Certified-tutor and a BWF level-2 coach.
