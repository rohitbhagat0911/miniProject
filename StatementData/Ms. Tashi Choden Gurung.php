<p>It was in the year 2002 when I was in class 6 when I came across a good friend, Dechen Zangmo in Kyi-de- khang school. 
    She introduced me to this amazing sport of which I had very less knowledge. She dragged me along with two other 
    friends to Palzor Stadium indoor hall for playing badminton for which I will always be thankful to her. Since then, 
    there was no looking back and it became a very crucial part of my life. Under the guidance and coaching of my very
     enthusiastic coach Shri. Thendup Tseten Bhutia, I started learning the technique and skills. The first tournament 
     I participated was state championship in the year 2001 where I won under 13 girls’ singles category and was runners 
     up under 16 girls’ singles category and from 2003 I started representing state in North East zonals, NE festivals 
     and Nationals and still bagging medals and trophies for my club and state. This sport helped me to become a wise, 
     disciplined and a better person.</p>
     <p>I thank my coaches Shri. Thendup Tseten Bhutia and Shri. Ravi Rai for their immense support and still believing 
        in me and pushing me forward to achieve more in life. I will try to give my best to take my club’s name to a 
        higher level and make it known at national level.</p>
