          <p>My journey of badminton has started after I left cricket in the summer of 2002. That is when I started going
             to indoor stadium and saw these two dynamic personalities playing this beautiful game of badminton. The two
              persons whom I watched were Shri Thendup Tseten Bhutia & Mr. Binod Pradhan. As I saw them playing, I felt 
              in love with this game. For few months I watched them playing and I learnt their style by watching for few
               hours daily, it was when Shri Thendup Tseten Bhutia called me and asked that am I interested in learning 
               the game that was when my life was about to change I without any hesitation said yes and started 
               practicing with them. Under the guidance of Shri Thendup Tseten Bhutia, I got the opportunity to prove 
               myself in the same year and participated in State Open tournament where I got the bronze medal in U-16
                singles category. After the tournament I felt that I have to work more harder and then I never looked 
                back. I had won all the state open titles starting from </p>
                <p>U-16 singles & doubles, U-19 singles & doubles </p>
                <p>Menâ€™s singles & doubles</p>
                <p>Mixed doubles & various open tournaments. I got the opportunity to represent my state and club in 
                    various tournament such as National, North East and had finished my BWF Level- 1course at Shillong 
                    Meghalaya under the guidance of two BWF coaches namely Mr Andy Adriyansah Mohamed of Indonesia and 
                    Mr Nikhil Chandra Dhar of Bangladesh.</p>
                    <p>This club have taught me how to stand on my feet and therefore I would like to thank my mentor 
                        Shri Thendup Tseten Bhutia and my seniors and juniors for being a part of my life. Finally, 
                        I would like to say to our upcoming young members of the club to remember the motto of our club 
                        and oblige on it. </p>

             <p>We can
