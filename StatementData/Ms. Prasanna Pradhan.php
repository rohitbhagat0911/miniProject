<p>Started the beautiful journey of badminton in the year 2004 when I was studying in standard IV. I had never thought it wud become a part of my life. Well, talking about YSS, it has given me so much and my achievements were possible only because of my coaches Shri Thendup Tseten Bhutia and Shri Ravi Rai. The first tournament I participated was state championship in the year 2004 where i had reached semifinal in Under 13 girls’ category and from the next year itself i.e. 2005 i started representing state in North east zonals & north east festival.
</p>

<p>The discipline and positive thinking that I have learnt from this sport has always helped me to become a better 
    person. In this journey I have come across great personalities who have influenced me a lot.
</p>

<p>And I wish to keep participating in the various tournaments & win more medals for my club. 
</p>

<p>I wud deeply like to thank my coaches and all my seniors for da guidance.
Will come back soon 🙏🙏</p>
