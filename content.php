<h2>The Birth of YSS</h2>

<div class="content-body">

<p>Young Shuttlers of Sikkim is not only a club for badminton enthusiast of Sikkim, but has become an identity for the
     players. Started in the year 2001 when I just finished graduation from Hansraj College Delhi university, and after
      returning back home in Gangtok, I observed that there was lack of young badminton players in Sikkim and the very
       few there were but had no technical knowledge about the game, and the main reason behind that was  “No Coach” for
        badminton in Sikkim. I myself feel privileged of studying in St. Augustines School and meeting
        <span><a class="author-link" href="">Mr Raju Pradhan</a></span> 
         who was my Badminton coach and had taught me well, but it was my dear friend 
           <span><a class="author-link" href="">Mr Parayan Dixit</a></span> 
         who had changed my
          game from basketball to badminton. After my school it was 
          <span><a class="author-link" href=""> Mr. Bhupendra Sir</a></span>
          my coach in Hansraj College, Delhi 
          university, who had completely changed my game and due to his coaching had made me finish in a podium in the
           University level. But all this could not have been possible if it was not for my father 
            <span><a class="author-link" href="">Late Tseten Tashi Bhutia</a></span>
           and
           <span><a class="author-link" href=""> Mrs. Eden Lhamu Bhutia </a></span>
             my mother who had supported me in all my decisions, and
            we’re the financer during the organising of the tournaments by YSS.</p>

<p class="p-spcaing">Coming back to the courts in Gangtok and seeing all these I started to voluntarily teach the game 
    of Badminton for young interested players who never got the opportunity to actually learn the game. The first student
     for me was 
      <span><a class="author-link" href=""> Late Kuldeep Gurung </a></span>
     a very talented and disciplined player who went on to become a Junior State Champion,
      but unfortunately we lost him in a tragic bus accident in Imphal, Manipur in 2006 while he had gone to represent
       Sikkim in the Northeast Zonal Badminton championship. Another student
        <span><a class="author-link" href="">  Ms. Dechen Zangmu Bhutia  </a></span>
         @ IBM who also went 
       on to become State champion in Sub-junior, Junior and women champion, who was terror for others in the game due to
        her powerful smashing skills. 
          <span><a class="author-link" href="">  Mr. Binod Pradhan  </a></span>
        the champion in the Junior and Men’s event and due to his talent 
        got selected in the Indian Air Force and represented the Indian IAF team in National circuit.
            <span><a class="author-link" href="">  Ms. Ranjana Tamang  </a></span>
        also a former champion in Junior and Women’s singles event. Another student who did wonders in the game through 
        his talent 
         <span><a class="author-link" href="">  Mr Ravi Rai  </a></span>
         who was also a former Junior and Men’s champion in doubles and singles event and presently 
        a state coach in badminton after completing his BWF level 1 course. 
         <span><a class="author-link" href=""> Mr Tshering Sandup </a></span>
         the wonder boy who was 
        also a champion in junior and Mens event and now a proud coach in the Prime Star Sports Academy Dubai after
         completing his NIS course.
        <span><a class="author-link" href=""> Ms. Prasanna Pradhan </a></span>
          the wizard of the game who has never learned to lose and was a
          former champion in Sub Junior,  Junior and women singles event and still Mixed Doubles champion of our state. 
          To add some more champions we have 
           <span><a class="author-link" href=""> Ms Tashi Choden Gurung </a></span>
           the hardworking player who has the motto “Never give
           up” 
            <span><a class="author-link" href=""> Mr Tshering Pintso </a></span>
            “Mr Lee Ching Wei” of Sikkim 
             <span><a class="author-link" href=""> Mr Sameer Gurung </a></span>
             who is also our state head coach and the 
           first to complete NIC course from Sikkim,
           <span><a class="author-link" href="">  Mr Kiran Rai  </a></span>.

<p class="p-spcaing">Initially introducing the children to playing in the proper badminton court was a big challenge as 
    most of the seniors were not comfortable. But after our players started beating them the next challenge was to send
     them for Zonals and Nationals but had to really struggle as we also used to get the answer “ No funds”  and they 
     will not win the Zonal and Nationals. But after several meeting and arguments the children got exposure to showcase 
     their talents in the National  and zonal  meets.</p>

<p class="p-spcaing">“ No funds”  and they will not win the Zonal and Nationals. But after several meeting and 
    arguments
     the children got exposure to showcase their talents in the National  and zonal  meets.</p>

<p class="p-spcaing">YSS had also conducted tournaments like the only Inter School Team and Individual Championship the 
    “All Sikkim Interschool Team and Open Championship 2004” similarly YSS had also conducted badminton in remote area
     like Chungthang in 2011 and Rongli in 2016.</p>

<p class="p-spcaing">YSS being the oldest Club of Sikkim has taken up the responsibility for producing badminton 
    players, and till today is striving hard to produce champions in the highest level of badminton.</p>

<p class="p-spcaing">Last but not the least I would like to state that I’m very proud of my students for their
     achievements in the field of badminton and also in their life, and will still continue to make and effort for 
     producing champion badminton players.</p>
