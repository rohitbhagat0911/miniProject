         <p>My journey of badminton started in the
summer of 2001 at Indoor Gymnasium
hall Gangtok where i saw this dynamic
personality and state champion playing
singles after his daily workout schedules.
His name was Shri Thendup Tsheten
Bhutia. I watched his game days by days
and immediately fell in love with his style
of playing and his attitude. Immediately
I approached him and asked him to take
me under him. I remember that day
and now, it was a no looking back, we
decided to form a first ever Badminton
Club of SIKKIM i.e. YOUNG SHUTTLERS
OF SIKKIM along with the very talented
players like Shri Ravi Rai, Ms Dechen, Ms
Ranjana. Within a span of 6 month under
him I was the finalist at the state U-16,
and then the winning trophy U-19 singles
and doubles (finalist) along with Shri Ravi
Rai next year. With the support of BAS
got the various opportunist to participate
in the major India ranking tournaments
and NE games. From the U-19 trophies to
the numerous All India Inter institutional
tournaments and Airforce trophies to
Air Force No-2 (after joining the air force)
to the recent 35+ doubles winner
(jodhpur open), I have grown so much as
a player and a person. May be that is the
reason why badminton is called as "the
game of the gentlemen"
